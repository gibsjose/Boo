# Boo
###### *A fresh Ghost theme.*

## Description
Boo is based off of [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper), the default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/).

## Installation
To install this theme, download the latest release into your `ghost` themes directory and extract it, then restart `ghost`.

On Ubuntu:
```bash
export GHOST_DIR='/var/www/ghost' # Modify this to your Ghost directory
cd $GHOST_DIR/content/themes

# Extract archive here...

sudo service ghost restart
```
